# SPAQ
**Single Page App Quick-Start**

## Summary:

This is a simple starter pack I put together for those times when I need a simple base for starting an SPA.

## Includes:

* [Devlab](https://github.com/TechnologyAdvice/Devlab) config for running development in Docker
* Yarn-based dependency management
* Basic server (`/server`) with ExpressJS for hosting static assets and API services
* Basic client (`/client`) with JSPM and SystemJS
* Bootstrap on client for rapid prototyping UI
* Test suite with everything from linting to mocking to coverage
